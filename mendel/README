The mendel document file: "mendel_document.txt" explains MENDEL and file format in details.

Two types of genetic susceptibility models were included here:

1) single gene model: assumes all familial aggregation of cancer is due to one single gene
   Examples:
    -code file: single.f
    -pedigree file: pedigree.txt
    -locus file: locusbr.dat

   To compile, please run:
   $ gfortran -O3 mendela.f single.f -o single.exe
   which will generate an executable file called "single.exe"

   To execute, run:
   $ ./single.exe

   The result is saved in single_out.dat 

2) mixed single-gene/polygenic model: this also allows for a residual familial component due to other unobserved genetic effects in addition to the major gene.
   Examples:
    -code file: poly.f
    -pedigree file: pedigree_poly.txt
    -locus file: locus3.dat

   To compile, please run:
   $ gfortran -O3 mendela.f poly.f -o poly.exe
   which will generate an executable file called "poly.exe"

   To execute, run:
   $ ./poly.exe

   The result is saved in poly_out.dat
